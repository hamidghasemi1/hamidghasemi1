## 🚀 About Me

- 🧠 Passionate about artificial intelligence, especially deep learning techniques in image analysis.
- 🧪 I often read research papers and experiment with the latest architectures in **CNNs**, **transformers**, **attention mechanisms**, and **hybrid models**.
- 🔬 I not only reproduce state-of-the-art results but also **improve or adapt them** by mixing new ideas or modifying them based on the task at hand.
- 🛠️ My workflow typically includes: understanding the problem deeply, benchmarking multiple research-based methods, and choosing or designing the best solution.
- 🎯 My projects often involve medical imaging, object localization, segmentation, classification, and anomaly detection.
